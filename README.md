### Project Overview
  * This project was created using React. It is a review of the fundamentals of React including components, props and routing.
  * Project is to recreate an existing project made using Angular.js of a Tap Room app
  * Project is only front end, no back end functionality at this point

#### Specs
  * App should display a header above each page
  * App should open to a Home page
  * App should allow user to navigate to list of brews
  * App should allow user to navigate to a form for adding new brews (no functionality currently)
  * App should allow users to navigate to an About Us page
  * App should include an error 404 page for incorrect paths

##### Set Up and Installation
  * Clone repository from https://github.com/thacheshirecat/react-tap-room
  * Navigate to the root folder in the console and run $ npm install
  * Run $ npm run start
  * Navigate to LocalHost:8080 in your browser

##### Issues / Questions
  * At this point there have not been any unforeseen issues in the development process. Installation and set up of the React Environment went smoothly, each component has been working as intended.
  * One question is whether global jsx styling can be added to child components or only the App component? If I add global styling to a child of App, would only that child and any of that child's children get those 'global' styling rules? I initial added global styling rules to Home which was a child of App but had no children, then later had to move those 'global' rules up into App.

##### Thoughts on React vs Angular
  * Forthcoming

###### Licensing
